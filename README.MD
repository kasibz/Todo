Extend your existing, personal To-do list application using Python Flask as a backend. Pick from the following features to add to your application.

Features
Store to-do's by date in a database (MySQL via XAMPP [mySQL.connector] or Snowflake [snowflake-connector-python]) or file.
Login button (authenticate on backend)
To-do list upload button - upload from an excel file (provided below)
Dark mode switch (frontend task)
Cache tasks list in local storage so user can open and close the website while loading the tasks (frontend task)
Create a custom feature!

Note
Silent work - library voice. Work on your own codebase. Collaboration is okay, but you will work on your own project.

Why
Why are we working solo? Everyone can get by in a group, but a solo project will determine who can build on their own. Who can stomp bugs by themselves? Who has true creativity?

Submission
Update your to-do list application Github repo. Create one, if you have not already done so. Submit as a message to Will and I on Teams at the end of the day. If you have not completed at least one of the features mentioned, continue working and submit at the end of the weekend.
